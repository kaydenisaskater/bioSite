                        Hope enjoys to go kayaking with friends and family. Her favorite kayaking path is the canal in Kearney, NE.
                        She said that she likes to go from the canal start, to Fort Kearney. The peacefulness of floating down the
                        water, and listening to the wildlife is the reason that Hope enjoys kayaking.

                        Hope began roller-skating during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. She has been learning at the skatepark
                        in her hometown, Apollo Park. She has traveled to other skateparks around Nebraska. Her current goal with roller-skating
                        is to do a handstand that the top of a ramp. Recently, Hope learned how to drop-in on the ramps, and explained that it is
                        her proudest achievement with her roller-skating.

                        Hope likes to go hiking and camping with her family in Colorado. She said that it is a great excuse to get away and not have
                        cell service. It is a time where her family can bond and work together to have an enjoyable camping experience. Hope gets to see 
                        beautiful views from the tops of mountains when she goes on her hiking trips.
