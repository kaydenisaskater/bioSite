                        One of Hope's favorite ways to express herself and her artwork is through oil paintings. Here is a self portrait that Hope made
                        in one of her painting classes at UNK. When asked about this self portrait, she said "I like to take regular photos, and then
                        alter them using a digital medium." She also likes to distort the images once she uploads them to her software.

                        Through the start of the pandemic, Hope picked up on roller-skating. Throughout the past year, she has continued to learn
                        how to roller-skate and also how to do tricks. Hope has recently graduated from UNK. She expressed how much this meant to her, 
                        and how proud she was of herself for completing the tough courses through the art program. She is also proud to have gotten a 
                        job within her line of work.
