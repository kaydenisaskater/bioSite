                        Hope Schwartz was born on May 4th, 1999, to Tyler and Annette Schwartz. She has always been interested 
                        in the arts, as she was in gymnastics and dance at a young age. She was also in orchestra in middle and
                        high school. Her instrument of choice was the cello. Hope attended and graduated from the University of 
                        Kearney Nebraska with a Bachelors in Visual Communication and Design. She enjoys making art with the skills
                        that she has learned throughout her College experience. One of her favorite ways to express her work is 
                        through oil paintings. When Hope gets to make her artwork without limitations, she likes to make the artwork
                        like a punk-rock style. After graduating from UNK, Hope started working for the Safe Center in Kearney, NE.
                        Her role with the non-profit organization is to help prevent domestic and sexual violence and provide a 
                        safe space for clients. She uses the tactics learned at UNK to create visual artwork to promote safety. 
                        Hope owns two pets, an orange cat named Charlie, and a Jack Russel-Blue Heeler mix named Maya. Hope is 
                        proud of herself for completing her senior show. Her senior show was her final project that needed to be
                        completed to finish college, in which she is also very proud of. Hope enjoys spending time with her
                        family by going on hikes and camping trips. Her and her parents also enjoy watching films together, 
                        whether it be at home or in the theaters.
